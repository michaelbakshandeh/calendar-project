# Diary of a Wimpy Bakshandeh- Cabin Fever

## Story of an Extended Time in Quarantine

While you were sitting at home during quarantine, have you *felt* like you're doing something different in your routine, but aren't quite sure *what's* different in your routine? One of the biggest challenges of transitioning to work-from-home or school-from-home is maintaining a steady routine, one which was clearly disrupted by the novel COVID-19.

The purpose of this project is to analyze how I spent my time during part of a six-week period of online learning at Amherst College. Data was recorded for two weeks and a Shiny app was made to demonstrate the results.

I analyze what the Shiny app shows and the implications of my Shiny app to my future as a data scientist.
