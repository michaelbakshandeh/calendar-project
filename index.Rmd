# Purpose of this Website

COVID-19 was an extremely tumultuous time for everyone, with most people experiencing disruptions to their daily lives and routines. I wanted to quantify the difference in routine that I experienced while transitioning from Amherst College to home. To best express this difference, I have created an interactive Shiny app that displays how my routine has changed and have analyzed the big trends that I noted.

# Motivating Questions

My primary questions of interest were the following:

- What classes did I spent the most time in during quarantine?
- Is my productivity related to my sleep patterns and, if so, how?
- What time of day am I the most productive? In other words, what time of day do I do the most work?
- How has the total time spent across broad categories that define my daily routine (school, exercise, social, family) changed over time? How has the amount of time I spend in each class changed over time?
- What is the distribution of the amount of time I spent in each category?

My hope was that I could glean some insights from this data about how I structure my time when I am in a less structured environment (Amherst College), where I had more explicitly scheduled activities and priorities.

And, to brighten the mood during these somber times, here's a picture of a cute puppy:

## Data collection

I collected data by recording all of the activities that I did over the course of two weeks. I made no intentions of doing these activities at these particular times; data was entered retroactively since the primary objective was to figure out how I structured my time with less explicit structure to my routine.

I explicitly recorded my data into 5 unique classes:

1. Data Science
2. Evolutionary (Computation, a CS class I was taking at the time)
3. Groups (Rings and Fields, ie Abstract Algebra)
4. Abnormal (Psychology)
5. Work (classified as any activity that was school-related but not under the particular umbrella of a class)

I also tracked each category's "description" as one of the following:

1. Sleep (was asleep)
2. School (one of the five classes)
3. Exercise
4. Family
5. Social (eg. Zoom meetings with friends, Netflix party, ...)

I also included the particular activity that I was doing. I decided not to include activities in my Shiny app simply because most activities had unique identifiers (eg, Groups HW9 would be different from Groups Study for Quiz) so it would be difficult to interactively look at how I distributed my time by activity. I also felt that was not the objective of my study; however, this is certainly a future direction to look into.

Each activity had a time stamp (beginning and ending time) and times are recorded in PST.

# Results

I made a Shiny app to display my results. Images relevant to the analysis will be screenshotted and included here, but the link to access the Shiny app is below. Git unfortunately does not allow for shiny apps to be embedded in-page, so please do click the link to open the app.
