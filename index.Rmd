# Purpose of this Website

COVID-19 was an extremely tumultuous time for everyone, with most people experiencing disruptions to their daily lives and routines. I wanted to quantify the difference in routine that I experienced while transitioning from Amherst College to home. To best express this difference, I have created an interactive Shiny app that displays how my routine has changed and have analyzed the big trends that I noted.

# How do I spend my time?

My primary questions of interest were the following:

1. What classes did I spent the most time in during quarantine?
2. Is my productivity related to my sleep patterns and, if so, how?
3. What time of day am I the most productive? In other words, what time of day do I do the most work?
4. How has the total time spent across broad categories that define my daily routine (school, exercise, social, family) changed over time? How has the amount of time I spend in each class changed over time?
5. What is the distribution of the amount of time I spent in each category?

I can include an image (not created in R) like this:

![cute puppy](./img/cute_puppy.png)

Create a "img" folder within your calendar-project repo and store the image files there.

# Data collection

I collected data by . . . 

I can write a bulleted list like this:

- here's the first thing I want to say
- and I also want to say this
- lastly, this

And a numbered list like this:

1. First thing
2. Second thing
3. Third thing

# Results

I made a Shiny app to display my results. Images relevant to the analysis will be screenshotted and included here, but the link to access the Shiny app is below. Git unfortunately does not allow for shiny apps to be embedded in-page, so please do click the link to open the app.
