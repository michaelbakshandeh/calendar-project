Purpose of this Website
=======================

COVID-19 was an extremely tumultuous time for everyone, with most people
experiencing disruptions to their daily lives and routines. I wanted to
quantify the difference in routine that I experienced while
transitioning from Amherst College to home. To best express this
difference, I have created an interactive Shiny app that displays how my
routine has changed and have analyzed the big trends that I noted.

How do I spend my time?
=======================

My primary questions of interest were the following:

1.  What classes did I spent the most time in during quarantine?
2.  Is my productivity related to my sleep patterns and, if so, how?
3.  What time of day am I the most productive? In other words, what time
    of day do I do the most work?
4.  How has the total time spent across broad categories that define my
    daily routine (school, exercise, social, family) changed over time?
    How has the amount of time I spend in each class changed over time?
5.  What is the distribution of the amount of time I spent in each
    category?

I can include an image (not created in R) like this:

![cute puppy](./img/cute_puppy.png)

Create a “img” folder within your calendar-project repo and store the
image files there.

Data collection
===============

I collected data by . . .

I can write a bulleted list like this:

-   here’s the first thing I want to say
-   and I also want to say this
-   lastly, this

And a numbered list like this:

1.  First thing
2.  Second thing
3.  Third thing

Results
=======

I made a Shiny app to display my results. Images relevant to the
analysis will be screenshotted and included here, but the link to access
the Shiny app is below. Git unfortunately does not allow for shiny apps
to be embedded in-page, so please do click the link to open the app.
